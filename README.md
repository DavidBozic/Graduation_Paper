# Graduation_Paper
My graduation paper is in this repository. It is an online distance learning platform designed to support the work of the "Forg Academy" programming course academy.
The idea was to develop a way of educating people that is cheaper and more flexible than traditional education.

Tools: C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity framework, Identity, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, SQL Server Management Studio.
